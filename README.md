# Tetris

Here's a little Tetris project coded by Lukas Thalhammer, Ivan TodoroviÄ‡ and Daniel Menczigar in python 3.6 using pygame 1.9.6.
The soundtrack and effects were arranged, recorded and implemented by Lukas Thalhammer with the help and voice of Daniel Menczigar.

We do not own any rights on the original game and soundtrack of tetris.
