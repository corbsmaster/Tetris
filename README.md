# Tetris

Here's a little Tetris project coded by Lukas Thalhammer, Ivan TodoroviÄ‡ and Daniel Menczigar.
The soundtrack and effects were arranged, recorded and implemented by Lukas Thalhammer with the voice and assistance of Daniel Menczigar.

To start the game, run the menu.py file. Therefore a version of python 3.6 and pygame 1.9.6 or newer is required.

We do not own any rights on the original game and soundtrack of tetris.
